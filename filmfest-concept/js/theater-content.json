    "description": "Fires around the Bay Area caused a giant cloud of smoke that permeated a red color across the sky. It looked unreal and many captured the historical moment. I went outside and briefly filmed my morning, and then I went out and captured drone shots to help reveal the magnitude of the event.",
    "bio": "I work as a videographer around the Bay Area, and I'm a 3rd year film/english major at UC Berkeley. While I think it is important to invest myself in all aspects of filmmaking, I like to focus on cinematography and directing. I'm also an avid drone pilot, having my FAA pilot's license and being a sort of 'drone guy' for a lot of sets has presented me with many different opportunities in film."
