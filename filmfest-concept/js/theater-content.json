    "description": "Fires around the Bay Area caused a giant cloud of smoke that permeated a red color across the sky. It looked unreal and many captured the historical moment. I went outside and briefly filmed my morning, and then I went out and captured drone shots to help reveal the magnitude of the event.",
    "bio": "I work as a videographer around the Bay Area, and I'm a 3rd year film/english major at UC Berkeley. While I think it is important to invest myself in all aspects of filmmaking, I like to focus on cinematography and directing. I'm also an avid drone pilot, having my FAA pilot's license and being a sort of 'drone guy' for a lot of sets has presented me with many different opportunities in film."

    "description": "\"Beyond the Storm\" tells the story of Tuan and his neighbors during the hardship of Central Vietnam 2020's storm season. This is a short film project to tell stories that aren't usually heard of in the West; it was initially made with the intention of combining Cinema-Verite camerawork with a high-contrast Hollywood cinematography style, and apply it to documentary filmmaking. The Film carries a slight mock to the Vietnamese Gov management of poverty and how Climate Change is affecting different regions in the world.",
    "bio": "My full name is Duy Duc Le, I am a 19-years-old filmmaker from Vietnam. I attended SFSU for 3 semester, 1 out of which I only took cinema-related classes. I had to go back to my country after COVID hits and I'm planning on transferring as soon as it's safe to get back to the U.S."
